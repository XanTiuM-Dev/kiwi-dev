# Launch Specific Scene
Add this script into your project to add a shortcut to enter play mode after loading a specific scene.
Don't forget to edit the path to your scene. 

Default shortcut is `ctrl`+`0`
- This can be edited in case of shortcuts conflict 

**Important: **
- The script needs to be place in a folder named `Editor`, in order to be excluded from build
